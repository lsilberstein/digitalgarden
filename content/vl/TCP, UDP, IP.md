# TCP, UDP, IP

## Sliding Window

*Sliding Window* means that each communication partner might change the window size dynamically by, for example, reducing the size if a congestion is anticipated.  
Modern, fast networks can handle windows much larger than 65k ([[Request for Comments|RFC]] 1323).

> [!Definition]  
> The [[Window Field]] option multiplies the window's size value found in a [[TCP protocol|TCP]] header. The *scale factor* is carried in a new [[TCP protocol|TCP]] option, being sent only in a SYN [[Segment]]. A [[Window Field|Window Field Scaling]] option is a [[Segment]] without a SYN should be ignored.

With [[Window Field|Scaling]], the maximum window size increases to $2^{30} - 1 = 1073741823$ bytes or roughly $1$ GB.

> "If a [[TCP protocol|TCP]] receives a SYN [[Segment]] containing a [[Window Field|Window Scaling]] option, it sends its own [[Window Field|Window Scaling]] option in the SYN, ACK [[Segment]]."

\- [[Request for Comments|RFC]] 2323

![[Pasted image 20231113080411.png]]  
![[Pasted image 20231113080459.png]]

$3$ Bytes are used to indicate that the [[TCP protocol|TCP]] is prepared to do both send and receive [[Window Field|Window Scaling]]. It sends a *scale factor* to be applied to its receive window".

> [!Quote]  
> "Option is an offer, but not a promise."  
> "Both sides must send [[Window Field|Window Scaling]] options in their SYN [[Segment|Segments]] to enable [[Window Field|Window Scaling]] in either direction."

## Unknown Scaling Factor

In this stage, Wireshark does not see the [[Three-Way-Handshake]]. Therefore, this value may or may not be the true [[Window Field|Window Scaling]].

## [[User Datagram Protocol]] ([[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]])

> [!Definition]  
> [[User Datagram Protocol]] ([[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]]) is a [[Transport Layer]] [[Protocol]] to send messages from one [[Port Numbers|Port]] to another with a minimum of overhead.
> 
> - [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] is only transaction oriented (in contrast to [[TCP protocol|TCP]])
> - no connection means no [[Three-Way-Handshake]]
> - no reliable delivery
> - no data integrity
> - no ordered delivery

```

All of this makes [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] more appropriate for small amounts of transactional data as well as for time-sensitive processes.

- Retransmission means bigger [[Latency]]
- Handshaking for a connection means overhead

## Background

![[Pasted image 20231114081935.png]]

The [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] Header is way smaller than the [[TCP protocol|TCP]] header ($8$ vs. $20$ Bytes).

1. *Source [[Port Numbers|Port]]* is an optional [[Port Numbers|Port]] and might be used for a reply. If the source [[Port Numbers|Port]] is zero, it should not be used.
2. *Checksum* is also not mandatory. An all zero transmitted checksum value means that the transmitter generated no checksum. If the computed checksum is zero, it is transmitted as all ones.

![[Pasted image 20231113083338.png]]

## Where is [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] Used?

Live Streaming of audio or video: [[Packets]] loss is here to some extent OK (due to limitation of human sensory organs). Rather low [[Latency]] is essential. [[TCP protocol|TCP]] is better for Video on demand.

[[Application Layer|L7]] protocols or other tasks with low overhead requirements:

| Name | Detail |
| ---- | ---- |
| [[Simple Network Management Protocol]] ([[Simple Network Management Protocol\|SNMP]]) | [[User Datagram Protocol\|UDP]] [[Port Numbers\|Port]] 161 |
| DNS | [[User Datagram Protocol\|UDP]] [[Port Numbers\|Port]] 53 |

## [[IP protocol|Internet Protocol]] ([[IP protocol|IP]])

There are two versions of the [[IP protocol|Internet Protocol]] ([[IPv4]] and [[IPv6]]). The [[IP protocol|IP]] has its own [[Packets|Protocol Data Unit]], also called a [[Datagram]]. Like any other [[Protocol]], such as [[TCP protocol|TCP]], [[IP protocol|IP]] has its own header. It carries other [[IP protocol|Internet Protocol]]s from [[Transport Layer|L4]] and even [[Network Layer|L3]] in the [[OSI reference model]], such as

- [[TCP protocol|TCP]]
- [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]]
- [[Internet Control Message Protocol|ICMP]]

[[IP protocol|IP]] is responsible for *moving [[Packets]]* of data from host to host. [[IP protocol|IP]] provides *unreliable [[Datagram]] [[Routing]]* over a path between hosts.

## [[IPv4]] Header

Firstly developed in the 1970s. Its [[Request for Comments|RFC]] 791 was published in 1981:

![[Pasted image 20231113090518.png]]

The [[IP Address]] (source and destination) is 32-Bit and is intended to

- identify an individual host on a [[Networking|Network]]
- refer to a specific machine in cyberspace
 
![[Pasted image 20231114082744.png]]

An [[IPv4|IPv4]] address uses a readable *dotted decimal* notation. Every [[IPv4]] address has two parts: A *Network Address component* and a *Host Address component*. One part identifies the [[Networking|Network]] (or a specific [[Local Area Network|LAN]]). The other part identifies the specific *host*. The *embedded structure* helps to create smaller [[Networking|Networks]] (domains). It helps to better utilise the bits in the host address part. An [[IP protocol|IP]] network can be subdivided into smaller [[Networking|Networks]], also called *[[Subnet|Subnets]]*.

![[Pasted image 20231114083720.png]]

### [[IP Header Length (IPv4)]]

IP header length means the total header length in 32 bit word (usually 5), which points to the beginning of data. 

### [[Total Length (IPv4)]]

Total Length is the length of data and header in bytes. It allows to length of a [[Datagram]] to be up to 65kb of data.

### [[Protocol (IPv4)]]

[[Protocol (IPv4)|Protocol]] describes the next level [[Protocol]]. It indicates the next level [[Protocol]] used in the payload (data portion) of the [[Datagram]]. It can also be another [[Network Layer|L3]] [[Protocol]]. Values are defined in [RFC 790: Assigned numbers](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc790).

### [[Type of Service (IPv4)]]

[[Type of Service (IPv4)|Type of Service]] determines how the [[Packets|packet]] should be handled in transit: Speed vs Reliability vs Throughput vs Precedence of a [[Datagram]]. In many [[Networking|Networks]], better performance for one of these parameters is coupled with worse performance of another one.  
When transmitting a [[Datagram]] through a particular [[Networking|Network]], these parameters are to be used to guide the selection of the actual service parameters.

![[Pasted image 20231113104901.png]]

### [[Fragmentation Fields (IPv4)]]

Header Checksum is a checksum on the header only. Since some header fields change (e.g. [[Fragmentation Fields (IPv4)|Time To Live]]). This is recomputed and verified at each point that the [[IP protocol|IP]] header is processed. Identification, Flags and Fragment Offset are normally not used due to security concerns.

### [[IP Address]]

> [!Definiton]  
> A [[IP Address]] identifies a specific host on a network.

## [[IPv6]] Header

Its [[Request for Comments|RFC]] 2460 was published in December of 1998. See here a basic [[IPv6]] header without extensions.

![[Pasted image 20231113090841.png]]

## [[Local Area Network]] ([[Local Area Network|LAN]])

> [!Definition]  
> A [[Local Area Network|LAN]] is a bunch of hosts connected and administered together, connected by known [[Networking]] components, such as cables, access points, hubs and switches.

The first [[Local Area Network|LANs]] were developed in the 1960s. They all belong the **one physical location** (home, building, office, school). A host might be a desktop machine, a server or a mobile device. Each host is identified by its own [[IP Address]]. There are two different deployment architectures for a [[Local Area Network|LAN]]:

1. Client / Server
2. Peer-To-Peer

## [[Data Link Layer|L2]] And [[Local Area Network|LAN]]

[[Data Link Layer|L2]] is the [[OSI reference model]] layer associated with a [[Local Area Network|LAN]] which is implemented via *[[Logical Link Control]]* or [[Media Access Control]].

```

## [[Local Area Network|LAN]], [[Networking|Networks]] And [[Router]]

![[Pasted image 20231113093419.png]]

Here, we see multiple [[Local Area Network|LANs]] connected via [[Router|Routers]], [[Hub|Hubs]] and [[Switch|Switches]]

## [[Logical Link Control]]

[[Logical Link Control]] makes sure that [[Network Layer|L3]] [[Protocol|Protocols]] remain independent of the technology used for the [[Physical Layer|L1]], i.e. media independent. Its [[Packets|PDU]] holds a 8-bit-source and a 8-bit-destination address.

## [[Media Access Control]]

[[Media Access Control]] synchronises access (from different hardware sources) to the same physical network interface. It ensures an error-free delivery to both [[Physical Layer|L1]] [[Protocol|Protocols]] and [[Logical Link Control|LLC]].

## [[Router]]

> [!Definition]  
> [[Router|Routers]] move [[Packets]] of data between [[Networking|Networks]].

## [[Hub]]

> [!Definiton]  
> [[Hub|Hubs]] are [[Physical Layer|L1]] devices which receive and pass electrical signals (bits). They are passive devices. 

## [[Switch]]

> [!Definiton]  
> [[Switch|Switches]] are [[Data Link Layer|L2]] devices which receive and pass [[Packets]] (also called [[Frames]]). They are *active* devices (they use software and firmware).

## [[Subnet]]

Each [[Subnet]] is bounded by an [[IP protocol|IP]] [[Router]] and assigned a new [[Networking|Network]] ID, which is a [[Subnet]] of the original network address.

### Why Use [[Subnet|Subnets]]?

There are four reasons for using [[Subnet|Subnets]]:

1. [[Subnet|Subnetting]] is a mean to enable *easier management* of networks.
2. It enhances *security through segmentation*. When a [[Networking|Network]] is divided using [[Subnet|Subnets]], it is *not* possible for the systems on one [[Subnet]] to access systems on another. This gives some level of security and isolation for the systems within a [[Subnet]].
3. [[Subnet|Subnets]] help to *preserve [[IP protocol|IP]] Address space*.
4. [[Subnet|Subnetting]] improves *performance of [[Router|Routers]]*. In a large [[Networking|Network]] (without [[Subnet|Subnets]]) with multiple branches, it is a laborious procedure for the [[Router|Routers]] to store all the [[IP Address|IP Addresses]] used by individual systems in all branches. A [[Router]] that keeps all [[IP Address|IP Addresses]] of a large [[Networking|Network]], requires larger [[physical memory]] to uphold performance and needs more processing capacity to sustain its speed.

> [!Info]  
> [[Subnet|Subnetting]] makes only sense on larger [[Networking|Networks]] (with 255+ hosts).

### [[Subnet]] Masks

Lets assume we use the following [[IP Address]] for a certain system.

```txt
01101000 00010000 00101101 01100011 104.016.045.099
```

We must find a way to know which part is used as the network address. The remaining part is the host address. Thats why we define a 32-bit number, called a *[[Subnet]] mask*. All bits that belong to the network address are turned *on*, meaning they are set to $1$.

```txt
11111111 11111111 11110000 00000000 255.255.240.000
```

The rest goes to the *host address in the [[Subnet]]* and turned off (set to `0`). See here an example for a *[[Subnet]] mask*.

```txt
01101000 00010000 00101101 01100011 104.016.045.099
11111111 11111111 11110000 00000000 255.255.240.000
```

The interpretation of the [[IP Address]] by means of the *[[Subnet]] Mask* with 20 *mask bits* and 12 *subnet bits*.

```txt
01101000 00010000 00100000 000000000 104.016.032.000 network
```

In this [[Subnet]], $2^{12} -2$ hosts ($=4094$) with unique [[IP Address|IP Addresses]] are possible. One of them for example is `104.16.45.99`. Here possible addresses would be:

```txt
from 01101000 00010000 00100000 00000001 104.16.32.1
to   01101000 00010000 00101111 11111111 104.16.47.255
```

However, the last binary addresses with a host portion of all `1` cannot be used for a host address, since it is reserved for a special purpose: *broadcasting* [[Packets]] to every host on a [[Networking|Network]].  
Thus, the first and last address in any [[Subnet]] cannot be assigned to any individual host. Available addresses would be:

```txt
from 104.16.32.1
to   104.16.47.254
```

## [[Networking|Network]] To [[Networking|Network]] Communication

The differentiation between [[Networking|Networks]] makes [[Routing]] more efficient.

![[Pasted image 20231114082928.png]]

## [[Wide Area Networks]]

![[Pasted image 20231114082928.png]]

[[Wide Area Networks|WAN]] stands here for [[Wide Area Networks|Wide Area Network]].

## Routing

> [!Definiton]  
> [[Routing]] is the process of forwarding [[Packets]] from a source to a destination.

Specialised hardware devices used for [[Routing]] are called [[Router|Routers]].
