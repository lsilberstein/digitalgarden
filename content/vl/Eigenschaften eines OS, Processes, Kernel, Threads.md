# Eigenschaften Eines [[Operating System|OS]], [[Process|Processes]], [[Kernel]], [[Thread|Threads]]

To recap: a [[General Purpose Operating Systems|GPOS]] is designed for user interaction. Many [[Process|processes]] run concurrently on said [[General Purpose Operating Systems|GPOS]]. There is a constant conflict between a **huge number of mostly concurrenting [[Process|processes]]** and a **limited amount of [[Resources]]**. This conflict is managed by a sophisticated management of critical [[Resources]]. This demands an intricate [[Operating System|OS]]-design, which is

- Much more error-prone
- a much more complicated security risk. 

There are four features that an [[Operating System|OS]] needs to accomplish to manage a tradeoff between the amount of [[Process|processes]] and limited [[Resources]]:

1. reliability
2. security
3. efficiency
4. resilience

An [[Operating System|OS]] needs to be [[Scaleability|scaleable]], because of a highly diversified ecosystem.

## [[Scaleability]]

> [!Definition]  
> [[Scaleability]] is the ability to serve every amount of users from one single user to a large number of clients.

## A Simplified view ([[Operating System architecture]])

Application Code has no or very limited access to system [[Resources]]. However, it has a *well-defined* set of available interfaces to the [[Operating System|OS]]'s [[Resources]], even though it has **no direct access** to the hardware.

When a [[User Application Space|User Mode]] Program *calls* an [[OS service]], an [[OS service]] translated that call to special instructions for a processor. The processor executes these instructions then to perform the task. When the [[OS service]] completes, the [[Operating System|OS]] switches back to [[User Application Space|User Mode]] and allows the caller app to continue. Doing so allows us to implement all four mentioned features of an [[Operating System|OS]].  
The scale and complexity of an [[Operating System|OS]] ecosystem is a critical factor in any discussion:

- The [[Operating System|OS]] needs to run on thousands of hardware configurations
- There are tens of thousands of software partners
- and hundreds of millions of users trying to use a certain [[Operating System|OS]]. 

For example, [[Windows]] 10 has over 700 Million monthly active devices and over 35 Million application titles with greater than 175 Million application versions.

## [[Windows]]

[[Windows]] was designed with *[[networking]]* in mind. In [[Windows]], there are four basic types of network software components:

- [[Windows]] network services
- [[Windows]] network APIs
- Network protocols
- Drivers for network adapters

[[Windows]] was designed from the start to be secure. To meet the requirements of various formal US government and industry security criteria. It was designed to work on a variety of hardware architecture. (*[[Portability]]*).

## [[Portability]]

> [!Definition]  
> In this context, *[[Portability]]* is the ability to work on a variety of hardware architectures.

## [[Android]]

[[Android]] was designed to be *open*, which means that its purpose is to run all sorts of devices. It doesn't make any assumptions of a device's screen size, its resolution, etc. A majority of [[Android]]'s code is open source. It utilizes a custom JVM that was designed to optimize memory and hardware [[Resources]]. Its ecosystem is fragmented due to differences of various [[Android]] devices.

## Essential Concepts

### [[Kernel]]

A [[Kernel]] is the core component of any [[Operating System|OS]]. It consists of a set of specific libraries to realize the essential functionality of anyÂ [[Operating System|OS]].

### [[Multi-Threading]]

A multi-user, interactive and connective system can only be realized with [[Multi-Threading]]. Multiple independent paths of execution are simultaneously in use.  

![[image_1i.png]]  
![[image_4.png]]  

[[Kernel|Kernels]] offer direct support for the underlying processor, thus functionality of an [[Operating System|OS]] is *tightly coupled* to a processor.

### Physical Memory Segregation

In most multi-user [[General Purpose Operating Systems|GPOS]]'s, a [[User Application Space|user mode]] code or application is separated from the [[Operating System|OS]] itself. It is realized by dividing the available [[physical memory]], which is in fact hardware, into two separate partitions: 

1. [[User Application Space]] ([[User Application Space|UAS]]) is an unprivileged processor mode, called *[[User Application Space|User mode]]*. 
2. Most [[Kernel]] related code is executed in the [[Kernel Address Space]] ([[Kernel Address Space|KAS]]), which is essential [[Operating System|OS]] code that runs in a privileged processor mode (referred to as *[[Kernel Address Space|kernel mode]]*).

> [!Warning]  
> Certain parts of the [[Operating System|OS]] code runs in [[User Application Space|UAS]] as well! *In other words*, most parts of the [[Operating System|OS]] code is executed in the [[User Application Space|UAS]], whereas specific functions of the [[Operating System|OS]] are realized in [[Kernel Address Space|KAS]].

![[image_24.png]]  
![[image_1y.png]]

[[User Application Space|User Mode]] code has very restricted access to system [[Resources]], Realized through a limited set of available interfaces to [[Operating System|OS]] [[Resources]]. [[User Application Space|User Mode]] has **no direct access to hardware**. When [[User Application Space|User Mode]] calls an [[OS service]], the processor executes a special instruction that switches the calling [[Thread]] to [[Kernel Address Space|Kernel Mode]].

### Process

Any application consists of one or more [[Process|processes]].

> [!Definition]  
> A [[Process]] is a container for a set of [[Resources]]

### Thread

> [!Definition]  
> A [[Thread]] is a *unit of execution* inside a [[Process|Process]].

Only [[Thread|Threads]] can be executed. All [[Thread|Threads]] of a [[Process]] share its address space and system [[Resources]].

### Monolithic Kernel

Most [[Operating System|OS]]'s are *monolithic* with a huge amount of LoC (Lines of Code) and are composed of **tightly coupled** components which do not seem to have different modules with different characteristics. All [[Kernel]] components are fully protected from errant user [[Operating System|OS]] [[Thread|Threads]]. Aside from the [[Operating System|OS]] itself, no other code has direct access to the [[Kernel Address Space|KAS]].  
*Drawback*: Failure or deficit in any [[Operating System|OS]] component can potentially affect other components or the whole [[Operating System|OS]]'s functionality.  
*Solution*: [[Windows]] for example implements several *dedicated protection mechanisms.* This protection is one reason why a monolithic [[Operating System|OS]] is both robust and stable (as an application server and workstation), yet fast and nimble from the perspective of core [[OS service|OS services]] such as 

- [[Memory Management]]
- IO

## Key System Components

[[Windows]], or any other [[Operating System|OS]], consists of several *well-defined* components. They are interrelated and cooperating. These components are distributed throughout the [[Kernel Address Space|KAS]] and [[User Application Space|UAS]]. Some related components might be grouped together to form a *layer*. For example, [[Windows]] has a layered design. [[Windows]]'s monolithic [[Kernel]] is a file (`Ntoskrnl.exe`), which is a set of functions.

([[Graphics Device Interface|GDI]]: [[Graphics Device Interface]])

Like almost any other [[Operating System|OS]], [[Windows]] is an interactive [[Operating System|OS]], meaning it's a GUI based [[Operating System|OS]]. It uses a subsystem that provides the GUI functions required, also called *[[Graphics Device Interface|windowing and graphics system]]* dealing with

- Windows and dialogues
- User interface controls
- Drawing
