# Type of Service (IPv4)

[[Type of Service (IPv4)|Type of Service]] determines how the [[Packets|packet]] should be handled in transit: Speed vs Reliability vs Throughput vs Precedence of a [[Datagram]]. In many [[Networking|Networks]], better performance for one of these parameters is coupled with worse performance of another one.  
When transmitting a [[Datagram]] through a particular [[Networking|Network]], these parameters are to be used to guide the selection of the actual service parameters.
