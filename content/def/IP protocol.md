# IP Protocol

There are two versions of the [[IP protocol|Internet Protocol]] ([[IPv4]] and [[IPv6]]). The [[IP protocol|IP]] has its own [[Packets|Protocol Data Unit]], also called a [[Datagram]]. Like any other [[Protocol]], such as [[TCP protocol|TCP]], [[IP protocol|IP]] has its own header. It carries other [[IP protocol|Internet Protocol]]s from [[Transport Layer|L4]] and even [[Network Layer|L3]] in the [[OSI reference model]], such as

- [[TCP protocol|TCP]]
- [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]]
- [[Internet Control Message Protocol|ICMP]]

[[IP protocol|IP]] is responsible for *moving [[Packets]]* of data from host to host. [[IP protocol|IP]] provides *unreliable [[Datagram]] [[Routing]]* over a path between hosts.
