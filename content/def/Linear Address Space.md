# Linear Address Space

The [[Linear Address Space]] denotes all addresses that can be formed on the system. An address for any byte in linear address space is called aÂ **linear address**. Today's system have around 46 bits of memory bus width, which corresponds to a linear address space of around 64 TiB. Intel only uses this term in its flat memory model.
