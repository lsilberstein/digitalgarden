# Real Time Operating Systems

A [[Real Time Operating Systems|Real Time Operating System]] is an [[Operating System|OS]] specifically designed to run with very precise timing and a high degree of reliability. This type of [[Operating System|OS]] typically only runs one program at a time. For example (network devices), medical devices, IoT, aerospace and so on. There may be some *regulatory compliance* for [[Real Time Operating Systems|RTOSs]] in place in order to guarantee security, safety and scalability.

> [!Info]
> For example, IoT demands pervasive connectivity, but also exposes devices and systems to more security risks.

There are two choices for software running on [[Real Time Operating Systems|RTOS]]: Timing might be guaranteed within a *margin of error*. A [[Real Time Operating Systems|RTOS]] might guarantee a maximum time for the operations if performs. Otherwise, possible catastrophic implications. (*hard real-time*).
