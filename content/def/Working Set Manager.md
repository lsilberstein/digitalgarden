# Working Set Manager

When [[physical memory]] runs low, the [[Working Set Manager]], initiates automatic [[Working Set]] trimming to increase the amount of free memory available in the system. The [[Working Set Manager]] examines available memory and decides which and if any [[Working Set|WS]] needs to be trimmed. If there is enough memory, it calculates how many [[Pages]] could be removed from [[Working Set|Working Sets]] if necessary.
