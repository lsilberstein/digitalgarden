# IPv4

## [[IPv4]] Header

Firstly developed in the 1970s. Its [[Request for Comments|RFC]] 791 was published in 1981:

The [[IP Address]] (source and destination) is 32-Bit and is intended to

- identify an individual host on a [[Networking|Network]]
- refer to a specific machine in cyberspace

An [[IPv4|IPv4]] address uses a readable *dotted decimal* notation. Every [[IPv4]] address has two parts: A *Network Address component* and a *Host Address component*. One part identifies the [[Networking|Network]] (or a specific [[Local Area Network|LAN]]). The other part identifies the specific *host*. The *embedded structure* helps to create smaller [[Networking|Networks]] (domains). It helps to better utilise the bits in the host address part. An [[IP protocol|IP]] network can be subdivided into smaller [[Networking|Networks]], also called *[[Subnet|Subnets]]*.
