# Working Set

> [!Definition]  
> The set of [[Pages]] in [[Virtual Memory address space]] of a [[Process]] that is currently resident in [[physical memory]] is called a [[Working Set]] of a process.

Each [[Process]] has an associated minimum and maximum [[Working Set|WS]] size. Default is 50 [[Pages]] min and 345 [[Pages|Pages]] max, though this depends on the version of [[Windows]]. When a [[Process]] is created, the corresponding [[Working Set|WS]]-size is determined.
