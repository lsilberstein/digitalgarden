# Object

> [!Warning]  
> [[Windows]] uses the term *[[Object]]* to refer to the representation for a [[Resources|resource]].  
> ![[image_14.png]]  
> The Term [[Object]] is not equivalent to the OOP term *Object* that refers to structure consisting of attributes and methods. It rather corresponds to the OOP term *Object* by means of a predefined structure.
