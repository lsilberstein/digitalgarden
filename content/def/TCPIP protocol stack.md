# TCPIP Protocol Stack

Communication over [[Networking|Networks]] is a complex task. [[TCPIP protocol stack|TCPIP]] is designed to break down the problem into smaller tasks. [[TCPIP protocol stack|TCPIP]] or [[TCPIP protocol stack|Transmission Control Protocol Internet Protocol]] is de facto standard.

## From [[OSI reference model]] to [[TCPIP protocol stack|TCPIP]]

David Chappell was involved in the development of the [[OSI reference model]].

> The bottom three layers - [[Physical Layer]], [[Data Link Layer]] and [[Network Layer]] - were intended to reflect the tree layers of the then-new X.25 [[Protocol]] for [[Wide Area Networks]].  
> The slightly more modern idea of a connectionless internetworking [[Protocol]] such as [[IPv4 protocol|IP Protocol]] was seen as *heresy* by the model's creators.
