# CPU Register

A register is a core part of a [[Central Processing Unit|CPU]]. Internal [[Central Processing Unit|CPU]] memory may hold a [[Central Processing Unit|CPU]] instruction, a storage address or any kind of data (e.g. a bit sequence or individual characters). Much of the instruction set of a [[Central Processing Unit|CPU]] will be tailored for working against registers, rather than [[physical memory]]. Accessing a Register typically requires just a few clock cycles.
