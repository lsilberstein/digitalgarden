# Hyper-Threading

Introduced by Intel, *[[Hyper-Threading]]* is a hardware technology that allows more than one [[Thread]] to run on each [[CPU Core|Core]]. The [[Central Processing Unit|CPU]] allows the [[Thread Context|Thread Context]]s per physical [[CPU Core|Core]], i.e., one physical [[CPU Core|Core]] is transformed to two logical [[CPU Core|Cores]]. This improves the [[Central Processing Unit|CPU]] performance considerably.
