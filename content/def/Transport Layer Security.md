# Transport Layer Security

In most cases, we use an additional [[Protocol]] between [[TCP protocol|TCP]] and [[Application Layer|L7]] ([[Presentation Layer|L6]]), also called the [[Transport Layer Security]] ([[Transport Layer Security|TLS]]) which provides encrypted [[Application Layer|L7]] data. [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]] has its own records with its own headers.
