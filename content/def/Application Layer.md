# Application Layer

> [!Note]  
> End user applications reside above the [[OSI reference model]] altogether!

Generic application [[OS service|Services]] like [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] or E-Mail capability reside in [[Application Layer|Layer 7]]. This layer establishes communication between [[Process|Processes]] and applications. It provides facilities that allow user apps to easily use the lower layers.
