# Android

[[Android]] was designed to be *open*, which means that its purpose is to run all sorts of devices. It doesn't make any assumptions of a device's screen size, its resolution, etc. A majority of [[Android]]'s code is open source. It utilizes a custom JVM that was designed to optimize memory and hardware [[Resources]]. Its ecosystem is fragmented due to differences of various [[Android]] devices.
