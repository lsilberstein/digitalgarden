# Transport Layer
Its main purpose is the communication between two certain [[Process|Processes]]. There is the possibility to shield higher layers from having to deal with details of network behaviour such as

- dropped [[Packets]]
- [[Packets]] delivered out of sequence
- [[Packets]] corrupted by error

[[Transport Layer]] allows to be a Error-free delivery [[OS service|Service]], a Sequence and a guaranteed delivery [[OS service|Service]]. Or just fast P2P delivery without all the *operational overhead* mentioned above.
