# Session Manager

The [[Session Manager]] is the first [[User Application Space|User mode]] [[Process]] created in the system. `Smss.exe` is the corresponding image file, aka executable. `Smss.exe` can create further [[Session|sessions]] at the same time by creating multiple instances of itself during boot-up.
