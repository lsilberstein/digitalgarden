# Page Fault Exception

[[Page Fault Exception|Page Fault Exception]] is an [[Exception|Exception]]. If a [[Process]] references a byte in a [[Pages|Page]] of memory that is currently stored on disk, a *[[Page Fault Exception]]* may occur, generated by the [[Central Processing Unit|CPU]]. A [[Page Fault Exception]] signals to the [[Operating System|OS]] [[Memory Management|MemMan]], that it should load the [[Pages|Page]] to [[physical memory]].

> [!Warning]  
> The slot in [[physical memory]] that the [[Pages|Page]] will be loaded into is called a [[Frames|Page Frame]].

If the code, running in [[User Application Space|User mode]], attempts to write to a read-only [[Pages|Page]], a [[Page Fault Exception]] occurs as well.
