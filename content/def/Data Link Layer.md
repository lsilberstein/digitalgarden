# Data Link Layer

[[Data Link Layer|L2]] is basically the [[Local Area Network]] ([[Local Area Network|LAN]]) layer to move data across one *hop*. We use a *point-to-point* or a *one-to-many* transfer. It prepares [[Frames]] for the physical transmission and provides a mean to identify the real hosts (sender and receiver), as well as error detection.
