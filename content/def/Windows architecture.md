# Windows Architecture

![[Pasted image 20231020172322.png]]

See here an overview of the [[Windows architecture]]. This diagram is a basic view and doesn't show everything. For example, the [[Networking]] components are not shown. Also, none of the various types of [[Device Drivers]] are shown. Each [[OS service]] has its own private [[Process]] address space.
